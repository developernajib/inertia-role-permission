# Laravel Role Permission with Inertia V2
This repository provides a Laravel application that implements role-based permissions using Inertia.js with Vue 3. The application allows administrators to manage users, roles, and permissions within a web interface. It leverages Laravel's authorization features along with the Spatie Laravel-Permission package to enforce access control throughout the application.

Key features include:
- User management: create, edit, and delete users, and assign roles and permissions.
- Role management: define roles with specific permissions.
- Permission management: manage permissions that can be assigned to roles and users.
- Inertia.js for seamless single-page application experience.
- Vue 3 for modern, reactive UI components.
